## Online Demo

An interactive, client-side demonstration of the HRRPLLM prompt structure and simulated reasoning process is available:

**[➡️ Click here for the HRRPLLM Online Demo](https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/)** 
*(Replace with your actual GitHub Pages link after deployment)*

This demo allows you to:
- View the fixed contextual information and few-shot exemplars provided to the LLM.
- Input or modify the scattering center data for a test sample.
- See a *simulated* LLM prediction and a generated rationale based on simple heuristics.

**Important:** This demo runs entirely in your browser using JavaScript. It does **not** make actual calls to any Large Language Model API. The "LLM" responses are simulated based on a simplified comparison of the input scattering centers to the predefined prototypes. It serves to illustrate the concept and the type of information an LLM would process.

### How to Run the Demo Locally
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
